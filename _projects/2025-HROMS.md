HROMS (2025-2029) "Hybrid Regional Ocean Modeling Systems"

Summary. 
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Regional ocean models are essential for forecasting and studying the impacts of climate change on coastal and regional environments. However, running these models at high resolution is computationally expensive, and at these scales, physical processes often neglected in coarser models become critical for capturing ocean dynamics accurately.
We hypothesize that ocean variability continuously transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which can be modeled using approaches with varying degrees of freedom. These dynamics can be represented through hybrid modeling strategies that integrate a spectrum of physical cores—from multilayer shallow-water models, quasi-geostrophic models, and reduced-gravity formulations under scaling assumptions to full non-hydrostatic models—augmented with AI-based corrections.
The objective of this chair is to develop a multi-fidelity modeling framework that leverages this spectrum of physical models augmented with AI to represent various dynamical regimes. We also aim to develop AI models capable of predicting regime transitions, thereby enabling adaptive switching between different model classes. These models will be used to perform ensemble simulations of regional ocean variability under different climate change forcings, providing a computationally efficient yet accurate tool to explore a wide range of scenarios and to quantify uncertainty regionally.
